# ACS_Simulator

Simulation of ACS on different platforms

## Branches

`main`: Runs on Flight-Hardware-Like Hardwares, usually means Teensy3.5, Adafruit_LSM9DS1, H-Bridge, mag-torq.

`pcsim`: Runs on computers--really fast!

`monte-carlo`: Feature Branch, using the Monte-Carlo Method, runs a bunch of simulations and finds good parameters.
